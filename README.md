# Stardew Valley Easiest Fishing Mod
https://github.com/kaibrooks/stardew-easiest-fishing/

This mod reduces the amount fish move during the reeling process, making catches virtually automatic. It does not change fish apperance values, catch quality, bite time, fish availability, or crab pots.

Works with version 1.2. Standalone, does not require SMAPI or similar.

## Installation:
>Fish.xnb is the packed, ready-to-install mod file, use this file. Fish.yaml is the unpacked source code, it does not require modification or installation for the mod to work.
1. Copy Fish.xnb to \Stardew Valley\Content\Data\, overwriting the existing file.
